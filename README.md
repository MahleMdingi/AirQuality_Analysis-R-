# AirQuality_Analysis-R-Brief
In this project, I analyzed the airquality dataset available in RStudio. I performed data cleaning, created visualizations, and conducted an analysis to derive key insights on air quality trends.


# Air Quality Analysis in R
This project explores the `airquality` dataset in R, focusing on:
- Data cleaning (handling missing values)
- Visualization (temperature trends, missing values)
- Summary statistics (Ozone, Temperature, Wind)

## Key Findings
- Temperature fluctuates over time.
- Ozone levels vary significantly.
- Wind speed averages around 9.94 mph.

## How to Run
Clone the repo and open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio.
